"As any cognitive science expert will tell you, fun is a great way to focus the mind. Developers that aren’t enjoying themselves will slow down, write buggy code, make poor decisions, and eventually leave the project (even one that pays). Conversely, rampant fun will bring coders in droves, and give them a passion for their work that shows in quality, quantity, and goodwill. It’s a pretty good bet that optimizing for fun will produce a better product than almost any other method."
~~ Geoff Broadwell, in an O'Reilly article -Ofun, published back in 2005.

What's Perl's thing? Among other things, Python has dead simple syntax, Javascript ubiquity, Ruby Rails. Perl has things like CPAN, TIMTOWTDI. But I think it needs a new "thing" that plays well with Perl as it is (Perl 5) but also foreshadows Perl as it will be (which will include Perl 6).

Perl's doing great but would do well to step up a notch to insanely great.

The YAPC NA 2013 organizer wanted a theme that would work for him and most Perlers.
