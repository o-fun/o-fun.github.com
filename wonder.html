<ul>
  <li>
    Embrace anarchy. ... For a development project, <i>modern version control
    systems can give you “anarchy with an audit trail”</i>.    
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Cast committer rights far and wide.</i> ... [scan] a number of
    technical groups 2-3 times a day trying to hand out the committer bit,
    responding to people’s musings, and generally spreading awareness.
  </li>
  <li>
    If invitation isn’t completely automated (as for example with a wiki),
    make sure many people in different timezones have admin rights to
    invite a new committer, <i>>and pay attention enough to do so</i.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Working code is more fun than mere ideas.</i> Continuously push the
    team to sketch out ideas in code, committing quick and dirty
    prototypes that can be refactored as they grow. ... [if someone
    is] afraid to release “not good enough” code ... [ask] can they
    please put it somewhere linkable?
  </li>
  <li>
    Mentoring and even <i>answering basic questions should happen
    continuously</i>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <i>Encourage random fun tangents</i>
  </li>
  <li>
    Get every committer to add themselves to the AUTHORS file (this
    is a good choice to be a new developer’s first commit)
  </li>
    <b>Turn your project into a culture, <i>one that you would like to live in</i>.</b>
